# LitHub

## Inspiration
eluv.io is currently mainly a streaming and ticketing platform. As avid readers ourselves, we believe that literature has an immense amount of untapped potential within the NFT space, and eluv.io provides the perfect platform for us to securely share the joy of reading with people all around the world.
## What it does
LitHub connects authors with readers through eluv.io's NFT trading platform, allowing authors to share their literature as exclusive NFTs. 
## How we built it
We utilized the eluv.io API to enable upload, download, and NFT trading functionality for our backend. We leveraged CockroachDB to store user information and we used HTML/CSS to create our user-facing frontend. To deploy our application we used Microsoft Azure.
## Challenges we ran into
One of the main challenges we ran into was actually getting the eluv.io API to work the way we wanted it to. As this was our first time working with NFTs/blockchain, it took some time but we were able to overcome this with help from mentors from eluv.io. Another challenge we ran into was actually connecting the pieces of our project together as we used many different pieces of technology. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of overcoming the many challenges we ran into along the way and completing and deploying a working application.
## What we learned
We learned a myriad of things while working on this project. First and foremost, we learned a lot about blockchain, NFTs, and how to utilize these tools during development. In addition, we also learned how to use eluv.io's API, as well as the many features their platform provides.
## What's next for LitHub
The main next step for LitHub would be to scale our application to handle a larger user base. From there we hope to share LitHub amongst authors and readers around the world so that they too can take partake in the universe of NFTs to safely share their passion.
